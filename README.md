# The Last Light

The Last Light is a small pixel-art top-down survival shooter about holding a failing floodlit outpost against an endless horde. It uses a deliberately limited asset set and leans on dynamic lighting, projected shadows, procedural ambience, reactive effects, and escalating encounter design to create spectacle.

Play at [thelastlight.alexheffernan.dev](https://thelastlight.alexheffernan.dev).

The game is open source, self-hostable, and deployed as a multi-architecture Docker image on a Raspberry Pi.

## Current Release

The current release is a complete score-attack survival game. Runs are intentionally short: learn the outpost, exploit its barrels and floodlights, use supplies and aerial flares, and survive long enough to place on the global leaderboard.

## Features

- Mouse-driven top-down shooting with responsive recoil, impacts, casings, blood, and explosions
- Dynamic darkness, directional floodlights, aerial crimson flares, occlusion, and projected shadows
- Four infected archetypes with distinct silhouettes, movement, health, and audio behavior
- A wave director that escalates pressure and introduces threats over time
- Generator-fabricated flares and delayed supply drops containing health, adrenaline, or flare charges
- Procedural monster vocals and combat audio with a rotating original soundtrack
- Persistent global deployment count, leaderboard, and repository-driven changelog
- Development-only collision visualization that is excluded from production builds

## Tech Stack

- [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) for gameplay and rendering
- TypeScript and Vite for the browser client
- Node.js for static hosting and the small persistence API
- JSON file persistence with atomic writes
- Docker, GHCR, and GitHub Actions for ARM64/AMD64 deployment

The browser owns the single-player simulation. The server only serves the built client and stores aggregate deployments and submitted score records; there is no multiplayer session or authoritative game simulation.

## Run Locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite client runs locally with graceful offline fallbacks for server-backed menu data. For the complete production stack:

```sh
npm run build
DATA_DIR=./data npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Controls

- **WASD / arrow keys** — move
- **Mouse** — aim
- **Left mouse** — fire
- **F** — fire an available aerial flare
- **E** — open a landed supply cache
- **P / Escape** — pause
- **R / click after defeat** — redeploy

During `npm run dev` only, press **F2** to toggle collision visualization. The renderer and key binding are excluded from production builds.

## Build And Start

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm start
```

The client is emitted to `dist/client`, and the Node server is emitted to `dist/server`.

## Host With Docker

```sh
docker build --build-arg BUILD_TIMESTAMP="$(date +%s000)" -t the-last-light:latest .
THE_LAST_LIGHT_IMAGE=the-last-light:latest docker compose up -d
```

The Compose service binds to `127.0.0.1:3011` by default and persists data in the `the-last-light-data` volume. Override the host port with `HOST_PORT`.

Useful commands:

```sh
docker compose logs -f the-last-light
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Internal HTTP server port |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Persistent score and deployment storage |
| `CHANGELOG_REPOSITORY` | `AlexanderHeffernan/TheLastLight` | Repository queried for recent changes |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | unset | Optional token for higher GitHub API limits |
| `BUILD_TIMESTAMP` | startup time | Millisecond build time shown on the menu |
| `LAST_UPDATE` | unset | Explicit ISO update time override |

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a local template.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — run the Vite development client
- `npm run typecheck` — check browser and server TypeScript
- `npm run build:changelog` — generate the checked build fallback from GitHub
- `npm run build:client` — build the Phaser client
- `npm run build:server` — compile the Node server
- `npm run build` — run all checks and production builds
- `npm start` — serve the production build and API

## Project Layout

- `src/scenes/` — Phaser scene lifecycle and combat coordination
- `src/systems/` — lighting, audio, supplies, flares, and wave direction
- `src/ui/` — landing screen, modal, and leaderboard behavior
- `src/assets/` — runtime-ready game assets and typed load manifest
- `server/` — static server, leaderboard persistence, and changelog API
- `public/menu/` — landing-screen hero and title artwork
- `art-source/` — editable deterministic pixel-art pipeline sources
- `scripts/` — build-time metadata generation

## Architecture Notes

- Gameplay is a fixed-resolution 960×540 Phaser scene scaled to the available desktop viewport.
- Darkness and light occlusion use cached render textures and bounded shadow-caster updates to preserve performance.
- A deployment is counted when a gameplay run starts, including redeployments.
- Leaderboard records rank by eliminations, then survival time. The public single-player client submits these records, so the leaderboard is intended for friendly competition rather than cheat-proof verification.
- Persistent data is written through a serialized queue to a temporary file and atomically renamed.
- GitHub Actions publishes both ARM64 and AMD64 images to GHCR on pushes to `main`.
